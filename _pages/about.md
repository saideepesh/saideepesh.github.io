I am an enginner with a PhD in Artificial Intelligence. I previously worked as an [**INSERM**](https://www.inserm.fr/en){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} Doctoral Researcher at the [**NeuroTech Laboratory**](https://www.neurotech-lab.fr/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}, [**Grenoble Institut des Neurosciences**](https://neurosciences.univ-grenoble-alpes.fr/en/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}. During my PhD, I worked on building Spiking Neural Network architectures for the unsupervised classification of spectrotemporal patterns. The thesis was part of the [**ANR**](https://anr.fr/en/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} [**Brain-Net**](https://sites.google.com/view/brainnet-project/accueil){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} project, where I collaborated with both academic and industrial partners.

Apart from the PhD, I have a Master's degree in Artificial Intelligence from [**CentraleSup√©lec**](https://www.centralesupelec.fr/en){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} - Paris, France and a Bachelor's degree in Electronics and Communication Engineering from [**IIITDM Kancheepuram**](https://www.iiitdm.ac.in){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} - Chennai, India.

My research interests lie in the domains of Signal Processing, Machine Learning and Computational Neuroscience.
