## Artificial Intelligence Research Internship<br/>Development of an unsupervised SNN for vocalization classification<br/>INSERM (May - Oct '20)

This work was a part of the [European Union Horizon 2020 Project](https://ec.europa.eu/programmes/horizon2020/en){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}.

Developed an unsupervised Spiking Neural Network (**SNN**) with Spike-Timing-Dependent-Plasticity (**STDP**) for classification of vocalizations.

- Encoded raw analog audio into discrete spike trains with 'time-to-first-spike' encoding.
- Implemented a Low-Threshold-Spiking (LTS) Neuron model to mimic the activity of biological neurons by introducing a temporal dimension to the activation of neurons.
- Implemented the STDP learning rule to enhance learning by updating the synaptic weights of the network.


## Research Internship<br/>Analysis of minipig vocalization data<br/>INSERM (May - Oct '18)

Analyzed vocalization data and attempted to cluster them with Machine Learning algorithms like Principal Component Analysis (**PCA**) in order to facilitate mapping with cortical activity; critical for the development of a Brain-Computer Interface (BCI).

- Analyzed Minipig Vocalization Data (MVD) to facilitate mapping between MVD and cortical data.
- Studied spectrograms and labelled audio files of the vocalization data as grunts, squeals and screams using Spike2.
- Performed data cleaning and dimensionality reduction of the data through spectrogram analysis and noise removal.
- Coded functions to successfully implement clustering algorithms like PCA and t-SNE using MATLAB.
- **Techniques Used**: Spectrogram Analysis, Principal Component Analysis, t-SNE, Independent Component Analysis
